How to run the code :
 
1. Click on the executable file (.exe) provided in code folder.
2. A pop up of gui will be shown.
3. Give the parameter like kernel type and slack parameter value at the bottom of gui.
4. click on input on menu bar.
5. select Image data file and ground truth file provide in Data folder.
6. you can use menu option to visualize its RGB and Grayscale Image.
6. you can save this images using save_RGB_or_GRAYSCALE option.
7. click on output button where you can visualize True_pseudocoloured_image.
8. click on ovo vs ovr option which will show the output of ovo and ovr side by side with its accuracy and time taken for training.
9. click on confusion matrix button to see a accuracy report.
10. for saving output result choose save_output button.
11. You can safely exit using a exit button from a gui.


Results :-

1.Results are provided in output folder.
2.rbf_10_output implies that user defined kernel type is 'rbf' and slack parameter value '10'.
3.Indian_pines :-->
	a) kernel=poly , C=10
	one vs one  => accuracy = 78.39%, Training time = 6.29 seconds.
	one vs rest => accuracy = 78.62%, Training time = 21.16 seconds.

	b) kernel=rbf , C=10
	one vs one  => accuracy = 78.13%, Training time = 4.02 seconds.
	one vs rest => accuracy = 76.76%, Training time = 11.13 seconds.

  Salinas_A :-->
	a) kernel=poly , C=10
	one vs one  => accuracy = 81.99%, Training time = 0.16 seconds.
	one vs rest => accuracy = 79.94%, Training time = 0.45 seconds.

  Salinas :-->
	a) kernel=rbf , C=10
	one vs one  => accuracy = 87.77%, Training time = 46.34 seconds.
	one vs rest => accuracy = 86.80%, Training time = 240.71 seconds.
4. from result ovo works better than ovr in terms of time taking and accuracy.
